        <h3>Work Experience (Last 10 years):</h3>

        <h4>Receptionist</h4>
        <p>
            Freshwater Beach Holiday Park - Burton Bradstock<br />
            March 2024 to Present
        </p>    
        <p>
            With much previous experience working for this company, I have been able to build and maintain a great relationship 
            with the management and owners, who have always been happy with my work and gladly welcomed me back on a few occasions.
        </p>

        <h4>Delivery Associate (Self-Employed)</h4>
        <p>
            Hazel Winston - Exeter<br />
            November 2023 to March 2024
        </p>    
        <p>
            As a professional driver, I was required to meet high expectations on a weekly scorecard which 
            measured everything from customer satisfaction to driving safety. I was regularly one of the top performing drivers
            in the company. I enjoyed the challenge of the physicality of this job, delivering Amazon packages 
            to Exeter and the surrounding areas over the Christmas period. 
        </p>

        <h4>Lead Vocalist</h4>
        <p>
            Warner Leisure Hotels - Cricket St Thomas Hotel<br />
            October 2020 to November 2023
        </p>
        <p>
            As a valued member of a professional entertainment team, with many qualifications relevant to this field, I was able 
            to deliver a very high level of service to this company consistantly for a total of nearly four years. This required 
            a great deal of self-discipline, whereby I chose to put routines and structures into my personal life in order to deliver the 
            highest quality of service and performance that I could, week in - week out. My resposibilities included, rehearsing 
            and learning new material for solo sets and team shows, hosting day time and evening entertainment, performing to 
            the hotel guests daily, and interacting with guests.
        </p>

        <h4>Bar Supervisor</h4>
        <p>
            Freshwater Beach Holiday Park - Burton Bradstock<br />
            June 2020 to October 2020
        </p>
        <p>
           This was a great experience for me and my first experience working in a position of authority and I really enjoyed the 
           extra challenge and responsibility. From the outset, I was upfront and honest with my employers that this would be a 
           temporary position for me as I would be lookinmg to try and reclaim my previous job as soon as Covid-19 measures allowed, 
           and my employers were more than happy to accept this as I had left the company previously on good terms and they were happy 
           with the service they already knew I could provide.
        </p>

        <h4>Lead Vocalist</h4>
        <p>
            Warner Leisure Hotels - Cricket St Thomas Hotel<br />
            December 2019 to March 2020
        </p>
        <p>
            The same job with the same responsibilities as listed above, however my time here was unfortunately cut short due to 
            Government Covid-19 restrictions on entertainment.
        </p>

        <h4>Sales Assistant / Receptionist</h4>
        <p>
            Lyme Bay Holidays - Lyme Regis<br />
            January 2016 to December 2019
        </p>
        <p>
            A family-run, self-catering holiday letting agency. As a front of house team member, my 
            initial responsibilities for the company included advising customers with any queries and taking bookings over the 
            phone, handling and organising all the keys for over 350 properties and managing the arrivals and departures for all 
            guests on change-over days, liasing with property owners and dealing with any issues with efficiency. Over my time there, 
            I was entrusted with extra responsibilities which included creating and sending the monthly newsletters to the customers 
            and owners, managing all of the companies social media accounts, and managing all maintenance issues; liasing with property 
            owners, outside contractors and our in-house maintenance team to ensure all issues were fixed in a timely and affordable
            manner.
        </p>

        <h4>Lead Vocalist / Entertainment Team Member</h4>
        <p>
            Hoburne Holiday Park - Paignton<br />
            September 2015 to November 2015
        </p>
        <p>
            I was headhunted for this role on the back of my previous job at Freshwater Beach Holiday Park to join the team for the 
            remainder of their summer season. The role required me to learn established team shows very quickly, perform solo sets and 
            daytime/evening entertainment.
        </p>

        <h4>Lead Vocalist / Entertainment Team Member</h4>
        <p>
            Freshwater Beach Holiday Park - Burton Bradstock<br />
            March 2015 to September 2015
        </p>
        <p>
            I was already working for this company in a different role when they offered me the chance to move into this new role. The management team were 
            having a tough time finding suitable people to fulfill the role and knew about my skills in this area so asked if I'd be 
            happy to help them by moving to the Entertainment Team. This was an exciting opportunity for me as it was my first opportunity 
            to work as a professional vocalist in my career.
        </p>

        <h>Bar Assistant / Retail Assistant</h>
        <p>
            Freshwater Beach Holiday Park - Burton Bradstock<br />
            March 2014 to November 2014
        </p>
        <p>
            This was a seasonal job as the holiday park was only open between March - November. I had worked at this company as a Bar Assistant 
            the previous year and finished the 2013 season with a great relationship with the management and owners. It was thanks to this 
            that I was asked to come back for the 2014 season but in these two simultaneous roles, something that only myself and one other 
            employee were offered.
